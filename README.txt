5. Justification for use of libraries

	1. FontAwesome https://fontawesome.com/
	Used at: /store/templates/base.html (lines 15 & 16)
	Locally stored at: /store/static/css/solid.min.css and /store/static/css/fontawesome.min.css
	Justification: The navigational images use this font to display helpful icons to users rather than stating "Account".
	We felt that this lead to a better user experience.

	2. Open Sans from Google Fonts (by Steve Matteson) https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans
	Used at: /store/templates/base.html (line 13)
	Locally stored at: Not downloaded to project files (uses Google CDN)
	Justification: We came to the agreement as a team that a custom web font would make our store stand out and have a different
	feel to other stores. We use this font site wide on all pages to change the appearence of the text.
